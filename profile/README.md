When we started savecost, we chose Rust as our primary language for the long term future we are building. We love the safety and robustness of the language, the ability to write high performance, safe, and (mostly) bug free code and then fearlessly refactor and change it without common lifetime/ownership, memory safety or race condition problems.

That, combined with the openness and collaborative nature of the quickly growing ecosystem of and around Rust with crates.io and the tens of thousands of open source crates with a best-in-class package system, cargo, truly makes Rust a language for the next 40 years.

We believe that by openly sharing our work, issues, and ideas with the community, we'll create more opportunities for collaboration and discussion to bring us toward a great future for Rust and for the infrastructure industry in general.
